#Hey dawg this is the start for Assignment 3, I wanna get this git repo started
Hey unless they specifically have Junit said on them, I didn't do the JUnit because I forgot at first. This has been a very busy week, if I can get an extention until Monday at midnight I'd love you. Either way, I will get all of these exercises done correctly for or not for points, because I need the practice. Unless said otherwise though these are gonna be all the ones I could've done by Sunday night. I can send you an email or talk to you before/after class if that's possible. I am NOT giving up on your class.
                   \n Hey 10/04/21 update: Got so tired after work and me staying up late to code last night that i passed out immediately after work and just woke up. I'm so sorry. I'll get all the JUnit done for the classes I currently have by Wednesday, I'm so so sorry.
