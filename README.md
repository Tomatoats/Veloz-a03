#Hey dawg this is the start for Assignment 3, I wanna get this git repo started
Hey unless they specifically have Junit said on them, I didn't do the JUnit because I forgot at first. This has been a very busy week, if I can get an extention until Monday at midnight I'd love you. Either way, I will get all of these exercises done correctly for or not for points, because I need the practice. Unless said otherwise though these are gonna be all the ones I could've done by Sunday night. I can send you an email or talk to you before/after class if that's possible. I am NOT giving up on your class.
